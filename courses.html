			<h3>Courses</h3>
			<h4>ENG 3060 - Technical Communication II: Presentations</h4>
			<p>Taking this course allowed me to improve upon my skills surrounding technical writing and delivering presentations. I had the opportunity to collaborate within a team of three other students to suggest potential improvements to the university's Study Abroad Program. In this project, I had the role of project manager, and it was a great experience for learning how to best organize a team and ensure tasks were successfully carried out while working asynchronously.</p>
			<h4>CSC 3750 - Introduction to Web Technology</h4>
			<p>In this class, I built upon my knowledge of website design from high school and learned how to create responsive and interactive websites. This course served as a great foundation for understanding the use of HTML and CSS as well as the best practices for website development.</p>
			<h4>CSC 4320 - Systems Administration</h4>
			<p>This course contained several hands-on projects and assignments that helped me to understand Linux administration. Here, I created many shell scripts to perform actions within a virtual Linux system, such as managing users and documenting errors. I also worked with installing and using a LAMP stack, SquirrelMail, and a vulnerability scanner on a virtual machine.</p>
		
			<h3>Important Assignments and Projects</h3>
			<h4>Developing a 3D Game</h4>
			<p>In my Human-Computer Interaction course, I had the opportunity to develop a game of my choosing. I decided to create a 3D escape room game in Unity. In this project, I created C# scripts to ensure that my game was functional. I also created both 2D and 3D assets for my game. This game required the player to exercise a lot of logic to solve the various puzzles in each room; thus, I had to design the game with the end-user in mind so that the puzzles would be solvable but still challenging. This was a great project for learning the basics of game development, and it required me to be resourceful when I encountered errors in my game or when I was unsure how to implement a certain feature.</p>
			<h4>Configuring Primary and Secondary DNS Servers and a DNS Client Server</h4>
			<p>In my Systems Administration course, I set up a primary DNS server on an Ubuntu virtual machine, a secondary DNS server on an Xubuntu virtual machine, and a DNS client server on a Kali Linux virtual machine. This project involved many challenges, such as configuring each server to recognize one another; however, I utilized my problem-solving skills to overcome them.</p>
			<h4>Creating a Text-Based Game</h4>
			<p>As part of a final project in my Java Programming course, I developed a text-based dungeon crawler game, which used Swing for its GUI. In this project, I kept track of the player’s and the enemies’ health and damage points, and I had a random chance for the player to find an enemy, an upgraded weapon, a health potion, or nothing in each room they entered. This project was a great opportunity for me to improve my skills in Java.</p>
