			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>Hello! My name is Lauren Boughner.
			I am in my fourth year at Wayne State University, and I am majoring in Information Technology with a minor in Business Administration.
			Throughout my academic career, I have developed an interest in programming, and I feel that this is a great combination of my other interests, 
			as I enjoy working with computers and being creative. 
			My goal after college is to obtain a position in software or front-end website development.
			<br><br>When I am not working on coursework, I enjoy reading, drawing, and baking.
			I have two dogs: Max (pictured on left) and Oliver (pictured on right). I also have a cat named Alaska (pictured in center).</p>

			<h4>Websites</h4>
				<p>My favorite website that I use nearly daily is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.
				I enjoy using YouTube for listening to music while studying as well as watching gameplay videos in my free time.
				This website has also been essential for me to learn new skills both inside and outside of academics. 
				When I need assistance with understanding a subject, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/khanacademy" target="_blank">Khan Academy channel</a> has been an extremely valuable resource for me to use.
				YouTube has also proved to be helpful for art tutorials and tips.</p>

				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3Schools</a></li>
